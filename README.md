# Megaline-Plus

The purpose of this project remains to analyze the data provided by the telecom operator Megaline. With an offering of two plans, Surf and Ultimate, the goal of this project is to determine optimal capital allocation. We will determine which plan brings in more revenue. This will result in an adjustment of the advertising budget, as a means to further increase revenue. The dataset provided is a sample of the population of Megaline customers, across different cities in 2018. We will conduct further analysis on the client behavior, as well as look at other important insights found in the data.
